#  Raspberry Pi Wood Case - V 0.0.1
This is a plan for a raspberry pi model 2B case. However, with modifications to its design, this case should be able to fit a pi of virtually any size. The design of this case was inspired by the [Raspberry Pi Oak Case](http://www.instructables.com/id/Oak-Raspberry-Pi-case-for-under-10/). [Go here](http://imgur.com/a/7ioSi) for a full album of final product images.

This guide assumes some familiarity with basic woodworking practices. If this is your first woodworking project, something of similar difficulty to the oak case may be a better starting point.

## Materials
The materials for this case, especially wood type, can be altered to fit a different budget, availability, or preference. The materials used in the pictured case are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi Model 2B
- 2x pieces of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.2 cm birdseye maple. Can be cut from one larger piece*
- 4x #6 size 32 tpi x 2 in brass machine screws
- 8x #6 size locking washers
- 8x #6 size square machine bolts (chosen for aesthetic; hexagonal work fine)
- 4x #6 size hexagonal machine bolts
- 4x 1/2 in rubber bumpers. We used [these](http://www.rockler.com/non-skid-rubber-bumpers)
- 2x M2.5 mounting screws
- 4x 3/8 in diameter cherry wood plugs, at least 1/2 in long
- Wood sanding sealer
- Wood finishing wax
- Mineral spirits
- Wood glue
- Plenty of scrap wood
- 1x 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm wooden inlay (optional)

***Tip:** Most hardware stores will cut your wood to size for you.

## Tools
At minimum, these are the required tools to complete this project. However, having access to tools such as a drill press, table saw, or band saw make this project easier.

- Power drill
- A 3/8 in drill bit
- A 7/64 in drill bit
- Saw powerful enough to accurately cut through your wood of choice
- Disc sander
- Sand paper, grits 150, 220, & 320
- Wrenches for #6 size nuts
- Router with inlay bit set (optional)

## Method

Unfortunately, there are some missing pictures for each step. Refer to the beginning of each step for information on how to use the method images.

### Step 1: Cutting and Sanding of the wood Pieces
At the end of this step, your piece should look like the one shown in method image 1, but without the holes drilled.

1. Cut your two pieces of wood to the sizes specified, or larger depending on your preference. **Warning**: do **not** cut your pieces smaller than 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm. This is very close to the minimum space needed for the machine screws to fit and not come into contact with the circuit board.
2. Use painter's tape to tape your two pieces of wood together face-to-face. This is a good time to make sure the boards are exactly the same size.
3. Use a stencil, or one of the rubber bumpers, to draw a 1/2 in corner radius on each corner of the taped block.
4. Use a disc sander to sand the corners of the block to match the drawn corner radius. Clean and fine tune with a low grit sand paper or power buffer.

### Step 2: Drilling the countersink holes in the top piece
At the end of this step, your piece should look like the one shown in method image 1.

1. Choose which side you will want to be the top of the case. Draw a 3/8 in diameter circle, set in 1/4 in from each edge, on the face of the top piece. Refer to method image 1 for how holes are placed.
2. Use a 3/8 in countersinking bit to drill approximately 1/8 in deep. This hole must be deep enough to hide your screw head and be covered with a cherry plug. Plan accordingly. Be careful not to go too deep and drill a hole clear through the top of your board. **Do not remove the tape yet.**

**Method Image 1:** After step 2, your piece should look like this.

### Step 3: Drilling the main holes
At the end of this step, your piece should look like the one shown in method image 2, but without the square inlay cut.

1. Place some scrap wood beneath the bottom of the taped block, opposite the face with the countersink holes. This will prevent splintering.
2. Choose a drill bit that is approximately the same diameter as your #6 size machine screw. We chose to go slightly larger than the #6 size screw with a 7/64 bit. We recommend the same as this will allow for easier fitting in the final assembly. Drill the 4 holes in the center of each of our countersink holes, making sure to go completely through to the other side of the scrap wood block.
3. Use this time to, if you would like, round over the edges and corners with sand paper and a wood plane. 

### Step 4: Adding a cutout for an inlay (Optional step)
This is a purely aesthetic preference. This step will involve the use of a router to cut out a square the depth of your inlay into the top piece of our case. The cut will then be chiseled and sanded to create a clean square for our inlay to fit into. This is a difficult process to describe, and method pictures are lacking. So, before attempting this, be sure you are comfortable with using a router.

At the end of this step, your piece should look like the one shown in method image 2.

1. Rather than attempting to explain this process in full, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwS1NSg_EB4) explains how to use a router to cut out a pattern in a piece of wood. Use the following instructions as a general guide for how to create your own.
2. Draw a square with the height and width dimensions of your inlay on a scrap piece of wood. Ours was 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm.
3. Place another piece of scrap wood beneath the scrap with the square drawn on. Use the router to cut out the square through to the other side of the top scrap piece.
4. Tape the scrap with the square hole in it to the top of your top piece that will have the inlay.
5. Use the router with a bearing bit to carve out the square into the top board.
6. Finish and clean the square with a chisel and sand paper.
7. Using a small amount of wood glue, glue in your inlay into the cutout area. Let dry for the specified amount of time before doing anything else.

**Method Image 2:** After step 4, your piece should look like this.

### Step 5: Assembling the top piece
At the end of this step, your piece should look like the one shown in method image 3.

1. Place one machine screw in each hole of your top piece with a #6 size locking washer.
2. Place a #6 size nut with a #6 size locking washer on the opposite face of your to piece and tighten down each screw into the top piece (refer to method image 3 if this does not make sense).
3. Use a small amount of wood glue on the edges of each cherry wood peg and press or lightly hammer into each of the four holes. Let dry for the specified amount of time before doing anything else.*

***Tip:** if your pegs have a noticeable grain, try to align their grain with the grain of the top piece to achieve a nice look

**Method Image 3:** After step 5, your piece should look like this.

### Step 6: Cutting the pegs and drilling the mounting holes

**On the top piece**
1. Use a small handsaw to cut the remaining cherry wood pegs so they are almost flush with the face of the top.
2. Use a power buffer or low grit sandpaper to fully smooth the pegs down to the face.

**On the bottom piece**
1. Center your raspberry pi on the bottom piece. Make sure the board is not covering any of the screw holes and there is enough room for the nuts to fit. Mark the location of the pi's mounting holes with a pencil.
2. Use a drill bit for the size of your mounting screws to drill the two holes. We used size a size M2.5 mounting screw.

**Method Image 4:** After step 6, your piece should look like this.

### Step 7: Sanding, staining, and waxing

1. At this point, both pieces need to be sanded with a low grit sand paper to remove any inconsistencies in the wood. Keep doing this until you feel ready to move up to a higher grit. Once you have finished sanding with a 320 or similar grit sand paper, clean the wood with mineral spirits and let dry for the specified amount of time.
2. Use a lacote wood sanding sealer on both pieces of wood. Use two coats of the sealer. Use #0000 grade steel wool or a very high grit sand paper to lightly remove any inconsistencies in the finish.
3. Apply two coats of finishing wax to the top and the bottom, following the instructions on the wax container.

**Method Image 5:** After step 7, your piece should look like this.

### Step 8: Final assembly

1. Screw 4 of the #6 size nuts onto the machine screws, high enough so the bottom piece can also fit the screws.
2. Align machine screws with the holes on the bottom piece and push the bottom piece flush with the nuts.
3. Screw the rubber bumpers to the bottom of each screw.

## You're all done
Enjoy your new raspberry pi case!
