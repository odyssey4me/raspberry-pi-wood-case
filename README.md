#  Raspberry Pi Wood Case
This is a plan for a raspberry pi model 2B case, although with some modifications should be able to fit a pi of virtually any size. The design of this case was inspired by the [Raspberry Pi Oak Case](http://www.instructables.com/id/Oak-Raspberry-Pi-case-for-under-10/). This guide assumes some faimilarity with basic woodworking practices. If this is your first woodworking project, something of simialar difficulty to the oak case may be a better starting point.

## Materials
The materials for this case, especially wood type, can be altered to fit a different budget, availability, or preference. The materials used in the pictured case are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi Model 2B
- 2x pieces of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.2 cm birdseye maple (can be cut from one larger piece)
- 4x #6 size 32 tpi x 2 in brass machine screws
- 8x #6 size locking washers
- 8x #6 size square machine bolts (chosen for aesthetic; hexagonal work fine)
- 4x #6 size hexagonal machine bolts
- 4x 1/2 in rubber bumpers (we used [these](http://www.rockler.com/non-skid-rubber-bumpers))
- 2x M2.5 machines screws
- Wood sanding sealer
- Finishing wax
- Mineral spirits
- Plenty of scrap wood
- 4x 1 cm diameter cherry wood plugs, at least 0.5 in long
- 1x 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm wooden inlay

## Tools
At minimum, these are the required tools to complete this project. Most local and large hardware stores will **cut your wood to size**. However, having access to tools such as a drill press, table saw, and router make this project easier.

- Power drill
- Bit set for size #6 machine screws
- Saw powerful enough to cut through your wood of choice
- Disc sander
- Sand paper, grit 150-320
- Wrenches
- 1 cm countersink bit
- Router with inlay bit set (not necessary unless you are creating an inlay)

## Method

### Step 1: Cutting and Sanding the Base and Top Pieces

Begin by cutting your two pieces of wood to the sizes specified, or larger depending on your preference. **Warning**, do **not** cut your pieces smaller than 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm. This is very close to the minimum space needed for the machine screws to fit and not come into contact with the circuit board.

Using painter's tape, or any other tape that will leave little residue, tape your two pieces of wood together face-to-face. Use the
