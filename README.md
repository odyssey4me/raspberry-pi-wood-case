#  Raspberry Pi Wood Case
This is a plan for a raspberry pi model 2B case. With some modifications to its design, this should be able to fit a pi of virtually any size. The design of this case was inspired by the [Raspberry Pi Oak Case](http://www.instructables.com/id/Oak-Raspberry-Pi-case-for-under-10/).

This guide assumes some faimilarity with basic woodworking practices. If this is your first woodworking project, something of simialar difficulty to the oak case may be a better starting point.

## Materials
The materials for this case, especially wood type, can be altered to fit a different budget, availability, or preference. The materials used in the pictured case are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi Model 2B
- 2x pieces of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.2 cm birdseye maple (can be cut from one larger piece)
- 4x #6 size 32 tpi x 2 in brass machine screws
- 8x #6 size locking washers
- 8x #6 size square machine bolts (chosen for aesthetic; hexagonal work fine)
- 4x #6 size hexagonal machine bolts
- 4x 1/2 in rubber bumpers (we used [these](http://www.rockler.com/non-skid-rubber-bumpers)) with #6 bolts set in the bottom
- 2x M2.5 mounting screws
- 4x 3/8 in diameter cherry wood plugs, at least 1/2 in long
- Wood sanding sealer
- Finishing wax
- Mineral spirits
- Wood glue
- Plenty of scrap wood
- 1x 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm wooden inlay (optional)

## Tools
At minimum, these are the required tools to complete this project. However, having access to tools such as a drill press, table saw, and router make this project easier. Remember,  Most local and large hardware stores will **cut your wood to size for you**.

- Power drill
- A 3/8 in drill bit
- A 7/64 in drill bit
- Saw powerful enough to accurately cut through your wood of choice
- Disc sander
- Sand paper, grits 150, 220, & 320
- Wrenches
- Router with inlay bit set (not necessary unless you are creating an inlay)

## Method

Unfortunately there are some missing pictures for the end of each step. Step 1 and 2 can be guided by the method image 1. 

### Step 1: Cutting and Sanding of the wood Pieces

1. Cut your two pieces of wood to the sizes specified, or larger depending on your preference. **Warning**: do **not** cut your pieces smaller than 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm. This is very close to the minimum space needed for the machine screws to fit and not come into contact with the circuit board.
2. Use painter's tape to tape your two pieces of wood together face-to-face. This is a good time to make sure the boards are exactly the same size.
3. Use a stencil, or one of the rubber bumpers, to draw a 1/2 in corner radius on each corner of the taped block.
4. Use a disc sander to sand the corners of the block to match the drawn corner radius. Clean and fine tune with a low grit sand paper or power buffer.

### Step 2: Drilling the countersink holes in the top piece
This step involves creating a countersink for our machine screws in each corner of the top of the case. This will allow  our machine screws to sit beneath the top of the board, rather than sitting proud of it. We can then use the 3/8 in cherry pegs to hide the screw heads and create a sleek, smooth look.
**Note: The following step can be combined with step 3 if you own a countersink bit that is 3/8 in with a #6 size bit. Simply drill the holes using the countersink bit while the blocks are still taped together.**

1. Choose which side you will want to be the top of the case. This may not matter as much with basic wood, but with wood that has interesting grains you may prefer the more attractive piece be on top. Once done, draw.
2. Draw a 3/8 in diameter circle, set in about 1/4 in from each edge, on the 4 corners of the top piece.
3. Use a 3/8 in countersinking bit to drill approximately 1/8 in deep, enough so there is about 1/10 in between the screw head and the top of the board. Be careful not to go too deep and drill a hole clear through the top of your board. **Do not remove the tape yet**

**Method Image 1: At this point, your piece should look pretty close to this**

### Step 3: Drilling the main holes
Here we are going to drill the main holes that the machine screws will eventually feed through and hold our case together.

1. Get some scrap wood to place beneath the bottom of the block, opposite of where we just drilled the countersink holes. This will prevent splintering.
2. Choose a drill bit that is approximately the same diameter as your #6 size machine screw. In our case, we chose to go slight larger than the screw with a 7/64 bit. We reccomend the same as this will allow for easier fitting in the final product. Drill the 4 holes in the center of each of our countersink holes, making sure to go completey through to the other side of the scrap wood block.

**Method Image 2: Your two blocks should look similar to this, excluding the cutout for the wood inlay. If you wish to add an inlay, continue to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.**

### Step 4: Adding a cutout for an inlay (Optional step)
This is a purely aesthetic preference. This step will involve the use of a router to cut out a square in the top piece of our case. The cut will then be chiseled and sanded to create a clean square for our inlay to fit into.

**This is a difficult process to describe, and method pictures are lacking. So before attempting this be sure you are comfortable with using a router.** 

1. Rather than attempting to explain this process in full, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwS1NSg_EB4) explains how to use a router to cutout a pattern in a piece of wood. Use the following instructions as a general guide as how to create your own.
2. Draw a 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm square in the center of a piece of scrap wood.
3. Place another piece of scrap wood beneath the scrap with the square drawn on. Use the router to cut out the square through to the other side of the top scrap piece.
4. Tape the scrap with the square hole in it to the top of your top piece which will have the inlay.
5. Use the router with a bearing bit to carve out the square into the top board.
6. Finish and clean the square with a chisel and sand paper.
7. Using a small amount of wood glue, glue in your inlay into the cutout area. Let dry for the specified amount of time before doing anything else.

### Step 5: Assembling the top piece

1. Place one machine screw in each hole of your top piece with a #6 size locking washer.
2. Use a #6 size nut with a #6 size locking washer to tighten down each screw into the top piece.
3. Use a small amount of wood glue on the edges of each cherry wood peg and press or lightly hammer into each of the four holes, covering the screw heads. Let dry for the specified amount of time before doing anything else. **Note: if your pegs have a noticable grain, try to align their grain with the grain of the top piece to achieve a nice look**

**Method Image 3: Screws attached and pegs drying.**

### Step 6: Cutting the pegs and drilling the mounting holes

**On the top piece**
1. Use a small handsaw to cut the remaining cherry wood pegs so they are almost flush with the surface of the top.
2. Use a power buffer or low grit sandpaper to fully smooth the pegs down to the surface to get a nice, consistent height across the entire piece.

**On the bottom piece**
1. Center your raspberry pi on the bottom piece. Make sure the board is not covering any of the screw holes and there is enough room for the nuts to fit. Mark the location of the pi's mounting holes with a pencil.
2. Use a drill bit for the size of your mounting screws to drill the holes for the mounting screws.

**Method Image 4: Pegs cut off and smoothed with sand paper.

### Step 7: Sanding, staining, and waxing

**Both pieces**
1. At this point, both pieces need to be sanded with a low grit sand paper to remove any inconsistencies in the wood. Keep doing this until you feel ready to move up to a higher grit. Once you have finished sanding with a 320 or similar grit sand paper, clean the wood with mineral spirits and let dry for the specified amount of time.
2. Use a lacote wood sanding sealer on both pieces of wood. Use two coats of the sealer. Use #0000 grade steel wool or a very high grit sand paper to lightly remove any inconsistencies in the finish.
3. Apply two coats of finishing wax to the top and the bottom, following the instructions on the wax container.
