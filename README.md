# Raspberry Pi Wood Case
This is a plan for a raspberry pi model 2B case, although with some modifications should be able to fit a pi of virtually any size. The design of this case was inspired by the [Raspberry Pi Oak Case](http://www.instructables.com/id/Oak-Raspberry-Pi-case-for-under-10/). This guide assumes some faimilarity with basic woodworking practices. If this is your first woodworking project, something of simialar difficulty to the oak case may be a better starting point.


# Materials
The materials for this case, especially wood type, can be altered to fit a different budget, availability, or preference. The materials used in the pictured case are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi Model 2B
- 2x pieces of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.2 cm birdseye maple
- 4x #6-32 tpi x 2 in brass machine screws
- 8x #6 size square machine bolts (chosen for aesthetic; hexagonal work fine)
- 4x #6 size hexagonal machine bolts
- 4x 1/2 in rubber bumpers (we used [these](http://www.rockler.com/non-skid-rubber-bumpers))
- 2x M2.5 machines screws
- Wood sanding sealer
- Finishing wax
- Mineral spirits
- Plenty of scrap wood
- 4x 1 cm diameter cherry wood plugs, at least 0.5 in long
- 1x 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm wooden inlay

# Tools
At minimum, these are the required tools to complete this project. Most local and large hardware stores will ****cut your wood to size****. However, having access to tools such as a drill press, table saw, and router make this project easier.

- Power drill
- Bit set for size #6 machine screws
- Saw powerful enough to cut through your wood of choice
- Sand paper, grit 150-320
- Wrenches
- 1 cm countersink bit
- Router with inlay bit set (not necessary unless you are creating an inlay)
