#  Raspberry Pi Wood Case
This is a plan for a raspberry pi model 2B case, although with some modifications should be able to fit a pi of virtually any size. The design of this case was inspired by the [Raspberry Pi Oak Case](http://www.instructables.com/id/Oak-Raspberry-Pi-case-for-under-10/). This guide assumes some faimilarity with basic woodworking practices. If this is your first woodworking project, something of simialar difficulty to the oak case may be a better starting point.

## Materials
The materials for this case, especially wood type, can be altered to fit a different budget, availability, or preference. The materials used in the pictured case are:

- 1x Raspberry Pi Model 2B
- 2x pieces of 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm x 1.2 cm birdseye maple (can be cut from one larger piece)
- 4x #6 size 32 tpi x 2 in brass machine screws
- 8x #6 size locking washers
- 8x #6 size square machine bolts (chosen for aesthetic; hexagonal work fine)
- 4x #6 size hexagonal machine bolts
- 4x 1/2 in rubber bumpers (we used [these](http://www.rockler.com/non-skid-rubber-bumpers))
- 2x M2.5 machines screws
- Wood sanding sealer
- Finishing wax
- Mineral spirits
- Plenty of scrap wood
- 4x 3/8 in diameter cherry wood plugs, at least 0.5 in long
- 1x 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm wooden inlay

## Tools
At minimum, these are the required tools to complete this project. Most local and large hardware stores will **cut your wood to size**. However, having access to tools such as a drill press, table saw, and router make this project easier.

- Power drill
- Bit set for size #6 machine screws
- Saw powerful enough to cut through your wood of choice
- Disc sander
- Sand paper, grit 150-320
- Wrenches
- 1 cm countersink bit
- Router with inlay bit set (not necessary unless you are creating an inlay)

## Method

Unfortunately there are some missing pictures for the end of each step. Step 1 and 2 

### Step 1: Cutting and Sanding of the wood Pieces

1. Cut your two pieces of wood to the sizes specified, or larger depending on your preference. **Warning**, do **not** cut your pieces smaller than 7.5 cm x 10.5 cm. This is very close to the minimum space needed for the machine screws to fit and not come into contact with the circuit board.
2. Use painter's tape to tape your two pieces of wood together face-to-face. This is a good time to make sure the boards are exactly the same size.
3. Use a stencil, or one of the rubber bumpers, to draw a 1/2 in corner radius on each corner of the taped block.
4. Use a disc sander to sand the corners of the block to match the drawn corner radius. Clean and fine tune with a low grit sand paper or power buffer.

### Step 2: Drilling the countersink holes in the top piece

1. Choose which side you will want to be the top of the case. This may not matter as much with basic wood, but with wood that has interesting grains you may prefer the more attractive piece be on top. Once done, draw.
2. Draw a 3/8 in diameter circle, set in about 1/4 in from each edge, on the 4 corners of the top piece.
3. Use a 3/8 in countersinking bit to drill approximately 1/8 in deep, enough so there is about 1/10 in between the screw head and the top of the board.

**At this point, your piece should look pretty close to this**
